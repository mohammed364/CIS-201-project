	<p>At Petrini’s Italian Restaurant, we believe that food brings families together and when you gather around the dinner table, something magical happens.

We are your home for the best Italian cuisine available in town. Our food is made fresh the moment you place your order. We serve up an array of dishes from large calzones to fresh baked pizza, and pasta. 

We believe in serving you only the best ingredients, which means we source the highest quality tomatoes for our pasta sauce, vegetables,  soups, pizza toppings, and meat for our main dishes.

Our restaurant atmosphere is full of laughter, love, and you will feel welcome from the moment you enter the door. Our servers will provide you with attentive service to ensure your lunch or dinner is special and enjoyable.

We welcome you to stop by today to try one of our daily lunch specials or unwind with a large dinner entrée after a long day at work. </p>
